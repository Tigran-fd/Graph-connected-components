# Graph Connected Components Visualization

This is a small Python project created as part of a lesson on graph theory and visualization. The project allows users to input a set of vertices and edges for a graph, and it visualizes the graph along with its connected components using the igraph library. The graph is displayed in a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, and Matplotlib is used to render the graph.
